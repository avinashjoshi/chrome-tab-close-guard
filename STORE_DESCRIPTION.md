Protects against accidental tab closes by showing a confirmation dialog. Perfect for Zoom meetings, Gmail, and important work tabs.

## Detailed Description

**Never accidentally close important tabs again!**

Tab Close Guard protects you from losing work by showing a confirmation dialog when you try to close tabs with Ctrl+W, clicking the X button, or closing the browser window.

### 🎯 Perfect For:

• **Zoom meetings** - Never accidentally leave a meeting
• **Gmail & Google Workspace** - Protect unsaved drafts
• **GitHub** - Keep your code changes safe
• **Notion & productivity apps** - Protect your workspace
• **Any important work tabs** - Custom protection for your needs

### ✨ Key Features:

**Smart Protection**
• Protect all websites or choose specific sites
• Use wildcard patterns (e.g., *.zoom.us for all Zoom pages)
• One-click "Add Current" button for easy setup

**App/PWA Mode Support**
• Enable protection ONLY when sites are opened as installed apps
• Perfect for Zoom, Meet, Notion when installed as PWAs
• Separate settings for browser vs. app mode

**Simple & Lightweight**
• Clean, minimal interface
• No tracking or data collection
• Works with Ctrl+W, Cmd+W (Mac), and clicking X

### 🚀 How It Works:

1. Click the extension icon in your toolbar
2. Add websites you want to protect (or protect all sites)
3. Optional: Check "App/PWA mode only" for sites you use as installed apps
4. That's it! You'll see a confirmation before closing protected tabs

**Note:** Chrome doesn't allow extensions to silently block Ctrl+W for security reasons. Instead, Tab Close Guard shows the browser's native "Leave site?" confirmation dialog, giving you a chance to cancel.
